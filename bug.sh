# This script attempts to process a file, but it has a subtle bug.
# The problem lies in how it handles potential errors.

while IFS= read -r line; do

  #In case of error, the script will not print it and will continue
done < "$filename"

# The script does not check if the file actually exists
# before attempting to process it.

# If the file does not exist, the 'while' loop will not run at all,
# and no error will be reported to the user. This might lead to unexpected behavior.
