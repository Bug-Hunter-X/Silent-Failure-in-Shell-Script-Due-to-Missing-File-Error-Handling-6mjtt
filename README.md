# Silent Failure in Shell Script Due to Missing File Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in shell scripting: silent failure when dealing with file operations without proper error handling.  The script attempts to process a file, but if the file doesn't exist, it exits without any indication of the problem.

The `bug.sh` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.sh` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

This example highlights the importance of explicitly checking for errors in file operations (and generally in all I/O operations) within shell scripts to ensure reliability and prevent unexpected behavior.
